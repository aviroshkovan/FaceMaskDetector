# FaceMaskDetector
Over the past few years, as the world has dealt with the corona plague, masks have become an integral part of our daily routine that we must wear regularly when we leave home. This situation has created the need to incorporate the mask into our daily activities in a way that will allow us to function in a completely normal way. The system is programmed to deal with the situation in which a picture of a person is obtained, and there is a need to identify whether that person is wearing a mask or not. For this task a learning system is required because in order for the classification to be done automatically and in a way that does not require human contact, a learning system can reach a state where it can do the required classification and at high speed.
